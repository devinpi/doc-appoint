# Final Project for CS50W with Python and Javascript

## Project Name: *Doc-Appoint*

This project was created as the Final Project for Harvard's CS50 Web Development course. There were 5 other projects associated with the course as well.

## Overview:
In simple words, Doc-Appoint is an effective way for personal users or patients to book appointments with the doctors that are available on the platform.

### Why I built this?
Before starting the final project I took some days and thought about the problems and wanted to come up with a solution that could actually be used by people. That's how Doc-Appoint was created.

**The Story:**

While I was doing this course, I had some health issues and I was frequently meeting with doctors, visiting clinics and hospitals. In my hometown, while big hospitals have a system to manage appointments and patients, private clinics on the other hand don't have any good management. I visited a lot of clinics that still use pen and paper for appointments and keeping a record of their patients. I wanted it to be more organized which could help doctors as well as patients. Although there are softwares in the market that can solve this, but I wanted to give it a try. 

### What did I do to solve this? 
I  decided to design a system where a user could either be a doctor or a patient. User can register on the platform and after registering, user can login and will get access to the dashboard.

**Registration:** 

- For Doctors, after you enter your username, password, email etc. you will be asked to fill another form that will contain details related to your study, the services you provide, location, phone number, your education and experience. Once you complete it you will be authorized to access the dashboard.

- For Personal, after registering you will be asked to fill in your personal details like, Full Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Phone etc. After that you get the access to the dashboard.

**Dashboard:**

- Dashboard for doctor account will allow you to search for your patients using the search bar by their name. There are options to toggle betweent the upcoming appointment and the history of appointments. This makes it easier to manage the record of patients. 

- Dashboard for personal or patient account will allow to search all the doctors based on their name or the services they provide. There are options to toggle between upcoming appointments, history appointments and, browse doctors. In browse doctors, all the doctors available on the platform will be available. This makes it easier for the patients to maintain the record of their appointments. So, if I want to review reports from 6 months before, I can review it through my dashboard.

**Booking Appointment**

- When a user as a patient visits a booking appointment page, it has all the details of the doctor. There is a book appointment section. It has date and time field. As you select the date, the application will tell you what all appointment times are booked for that date. After selecting the right date and time, book the appointment. 

*Note: You can only book appointment with a particular doctor once your previous appointment date has passed.*

**Patient-Report**

- After an appointment has been booked with a particular doctor, that doctor can see it in the doctor's dashboard. The doctor can search for their patients and can add something to the patient's report through patient report page.

*Note: You only get to edit a patients report till the day of the appointment. After that that appointment will be shifted in the history section and report cannt be edited.*
