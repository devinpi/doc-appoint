# Final Project for CS50W with Python and Javascript

## Project Name: *Doc-Appoint*

This project was created as the Final Project for Harvard's CS50 Web Development course. There were 5 other projects associated with the course as well.

## Overview:
In simple words, Doc-Appoint is an effective way for personal users or patients to book appointments with the doctors that are available on the platform.

### Why I built this?
Before starting the final project I took some days and thought about the problems and wanted to come up with a solution that could actually be used by people. That's how Doc-Appoint was created.

**The Story:**

While I was doing this course, I had some health issues and I was frequently meeting with doctors, visiting clinics and hospitals. In my hometown, while big hospitals have a system to manage appointments and patients, private clinics on the other hand don't have any good management. I visited a lot of clinics that still use pen and paper for appointments and keeping a record of their patients. I wanted it to be more organized which could help doctors as well as patients. Although there are softwares in the market that can solve this, but I wanted to give it a try. 

### What did I do to solve the this?
I built a system where both doctors(doctor users-DR) and patients(personal users-PR) can register either as a doctor or as a personal user. After registering, you can login and you will get access to the dashboard.

**Registration:**

For Doctors, after you enter your username, password, email etc. you will be asked to fill another form that will contain details related to your study, the services you provide, location, phone number, your education and experience. Once you complete it you will be authorized to access the dashboard.

For Personal, after registering you will be asked to fill in your personal details like, Full Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Phone etc. After that you get the access to the dashboard.

**Dashboard for Doctor Account:**

 Dashboard for doctor account will allow you to search for your patients using the search bar by their name. There are options that can be used to toggle betweent the upcoming appointment and the history of appointments for a proper record of the patient.
